##Project Abstract 

In the age of social media, the interactions between people, the news, influencers, and everyone in between is the driving force of how information is spread. Public discourse plays an important role in the shaping of environmental awareness. This project will analyze how platforms are used to discuss and mobilize environmental justice, and the correlation of these online trends with actual environmental inequalities. Using the Kaggle dataset “Global Climate Action Social Media Trends 2024-25”, we’ll track metrics on posts, hashtags, sentiment, and geography of climate-related content. Aiming to identify patterns in people “digital activism” and compare the alignment or divergence from actual climate disparities. Our key questions include: Which regions lead environmental justice discourse? Does social media engagement have correlation to pollution levels or environmental risks? Can we map digital activism to real world outcomes by merging the dataset with outside environmental indicators. The final objective is a Streamlit dashboard that helps visualize climate related social media trends in the lens of justice metrics. Including filters by region, time, and themes. This tool will highlight any gaps in awareness, helping governments, local communities, NGOs, and anyone interested in the information to further push a voice in the right direction.

Contribution - My contributions to the team included helping with the video. I also contributed to the project by doing data research. I also worked mainly on the justification of our topic. Another thing was helping build the Streamlit application. Lastly, I contributed to the coding and assisted when needed.
